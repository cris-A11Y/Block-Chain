# Ethereum Security Monitoring System

An end-to-end framework for detecting smart contract vulnerabilities and on-chain abuse patterns (phishing, flash-loan attacks) on Ethereum. This repository contains:

- **Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection** using CodeBERT fine-tuning  
- **On-chain Abuse Detection**  
  - **GCN** (supervised) for phishing/scam address classification  
  - **GAE + KMeans** (unsupervised) for flash-loan anomaly detection  
- **Transaction Flow Visualization** with NetworkX

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Layout

- `contracts_vuln_detection/`  
  Contains modules and scripts related to smart contract vulnerability detection tasks:
  - `data_processing.py`: Loads the SmartBugs dataset and performs token/line masking.
  - `main.py`: CodeBERT fine-tuning and inference script.
  - `preprocess_single_file.py`: Helper script to preprocess a single Solidity (`.sol`) file.

- `onchain_abuse_detection/`  
  A module focused on on-chain abuse detection, including phishing and flash loan attacks:
